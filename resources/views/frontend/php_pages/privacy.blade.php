<p class="text-justify para_class"><p class="text-justify para_class"><strong>SUBJECT OF THIS DATA PROTECTION DECLARATION</strong></p></p>
<p class="text-justify para_class">This privacy policy applies to all services offered on our website. This Data Protection Declaration exclusively deals with the handling of personal data by JUSTAIRPORTS. In case our services are performed by subcontractors, you will find the information on the respective procedures below. In case you make use of services provided by third parties via the website, the data protection regulations of the respective third parties apply exclusively.

<p class="text-justify para_class"><strong>COLLECTION AND PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA WHEN USING OUR SERVICES</strong></p>
<p class="text-justify para_class">We collect, store and process personal data in accordance with GDPR for the handling of the transportation services and the technical administration. Any and all personal data is processed exclusively in accordance with the provisions of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<p class="text-justify para_class"><strong>USE OF OUR SERVICES</strong></p>
<p class="text-justify para_class">To book a transfer we need your first and last name, your e-mail address, mobile phone number and specific payment information. We need the first and last name, e-mail address and mobile phone number to confirm the receipt of your booking, identify you as a user and communicate with you. We need credit card information or billing information to process the payment.</p>
<p class="text-justify para_class">If you use our website, we will store your data required for the performance of the contract. Furthermore, we store the data provided by you voluntarily for the duration of your use of the website, provided that you do not delete it before. </p>
<p class="text-justify para_class">In order to prevent unauthorised access to your personal data, especially payment information, the connection is encrypted.</p>
<p class="text-justify para_class">It is your obligation to treat the personal access data confidentially and not to make them accessible to any unauthorised third parties. We do not assume any liability for the abuse of losing information (your password, reservation reference number and email address), unless we are responsible for the abuse.</p>
<p class="text-justify para_class">Your personal data will only be passed on or otherwise communicated to third parties if this is necessary (i) for the purpose of performing our contractual obligations or (ii) the handling of payment transactions or (iii) if there is a legitimate interest of JUSTAIRPORTS or the third party or (iv) if you have previously given your consent. This means that the transportation service provider or other external providers of services (external fleet partner), as well as their respective drivers executing the transfers, receive the necessary information (first and last name, mobile phone number, flight number, pickup address, destination address and time of arrival as well as information on extra requests) via the website. Moreover, for credit card payment purposes the payment processor Stripe receives the necessary information (first and last name, mobile phone number, credit card information).

<p class="text-justify para_class"><strong>FEEDBACK REQUESTS FOLLOWING THE TRANSFER</strong></p>
<p class="text-justify para_class">After every trip, you will be requested by e-mail to rate the driver and the vehicle. This rating only serves for quality assurance and improvement of customer satisfaction. The rides quality is reflected by a star system. The quality standards are important to us and we want to know if you are unhappy with the transportation service. Under this circumstance, we will get back to you by e-mail to ask questions about your transfer. At the bottom of each rating e-mail, you will find a link to unsubscribe at any time. </p>
